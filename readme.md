# BITS Clubs Website with Wordpress

[![Deploy to Azure](http://azuredeploy.net/deploybutton.png)](https://azuredeploy.net/)

This website was made with Wordpress acting as the Content Management System. This website is a college project made by me to ensure that different clubs of the college could add events and announcements. Different accounts are made for different clubs with the help of the account management system provided by Wordpress. For a live preview, click [here](http://bitsclubs.azurewebsites.net/)
